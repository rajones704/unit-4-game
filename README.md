# unit-4-game
//Make a game with 4 crystals and random results
//Each crystal needs a random # between 19-120
//A new random # should be generated every win/lose for the 4 crystals 1-2
//When clicking any Crystal it should add with previous result until it = total score...I think
//If it is greater than the Random result, we decrease lost counter
//If it is equal- then increment win counter
//Game must restart when player win/lose
//Generate new random number
//must make a win/lose counter
//Make a game with 4 crystals and random results
//A new random # should be generated between 1-2 for the 4 crystals
